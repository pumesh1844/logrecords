Log Record project

github link : 

Tools used:
	Nodejs,VSCode

As per the requirement I have created the log record project,
	I have done a simple calculator which includes addition,subtraction,multiplication,division.
	In division,when the denominator is 0,
	the error message is given in the try block and the catch block catches the message and displays it in the error.txt file which i have created separately in the same folder.


Thank you!
